        <h2>About</h2>
        <p>Welcome! My name is Saša Milovanović, a passionate JavaScript frontend developer with a recently completed
            course
            at ITAcademy. During this intensive program, I gained a comprehensive understanding of computing,
            development
            web applications and the use of various technologies, including HTML, CSS and JavaScript (including advanced
            concepts).</p>

        <p>After completing the course, I had the opportunity to apply my knowledge through an internship at the ENON
            Solution company, where I am
            worked on the challenging project "Everything about fitness". This internship not only broadened my
            technical skills
            it also gave me an insight into the real challenges in web application development.</p>

        <p>What sets me apart is not only my technical knowledge, but also a broad education that includes the basic
            knowledge of
            artificial intelligence (AI) and data analysis (AP), as well as the fundamentals of user interface (UI)
            design and
            user experience (UX). This holistic approach allows me to approach projects from multiple angles and
            provide innovative solutions.</p>

        <p>Completion of the course and internship are just the beginning of my professional adventure. I believe that
            age is just a number, and mine
            experience and motivation are the key factors that lead me to success. Enrolling in ITAcademy from this
            November
            I want to continue my education and deepen my knowledge and skills even more.</p>

        <p> This portfolio represents my steps so far, but also my motivation for the future. I believe that my passion,
            work ethic and desire to learn to contribute to any team I find myself in.</p>
